# UMovies

This is an Android/IOS application I developed utilizing Flutter and the Firebase Database. This app is designed as a simple way to keep a journal of movies and shows you have watched as well as keeping their rating. This idea came to me after I could not remember that I had already seen a specific movie. This is in no way a production app, and only is only in a test state. I do not intend to expand it further.
